## General Information
-Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.

## Conclusions
- Lending club should reduce the high interest loans for 60 months tenure, they are prone to loan default.
- Grades are good metric for detecting defaulters. Lending club should examine more information from borrowers before issuing loans to Low grade (G to A).
- Lending Club should control their number of loan issues to borrowers who are from CA, FL and NY to make profits.
- Small business loans are defaulted more. Lending club should stop/reduce issuing the loans to them.
- Borrowers with mortgage home ownership are taking higher loans and defaulting the approved loans.
- Lending club should stop giving loans to this category when loan amount requested is more than 12000.
